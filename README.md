# Description
Self Supervised Learning [Contrastive Learning + SimCLR] at www.self-supervised-learning.com

* This course teaches you "Self-Supervised Learning" (SSL), also known as "Representation Learning." 

* SSL is a relatively new and hot machine learning subject that deals with limited labeled data repositories. 

* There are two general SSL techniques, contrastive and generative. This course's focus is on supervised and unsupervised contrastive models only. 

* There are several examples and experiments across this course for you to fully grasp the idea behind SSL. 

* Our domain of focus is the image domain, but you can apply what you learn to other domains, including temporal records and natural language processing (NLP).

* In every lecture, you can access the corresponding Python .ipynb notebooks. The notebooks are best to be run with a GPU accelerator.

* Simply navigate to the section and lecture of your interest and open the .ipynb files in Google Colab.
